# Gameplay

## Gamemode
There are 2 teams of 3 players.
In the middle of the arena, there is a hole that spawns **currency** every few seconds.
The objective of the game mode is for your team to have 10 **currency**.
To catch the **currency** players need to collide with it, when a player dies, they drop all the **currency**.
Once a team reaches 10 **currency** a countdown will appear on screen that lasts 15 seconds.
When the counter gets to 0, the team with the most crystals 10 wins.
The countdown is canceled if the team falls bellow 10 **currency**.
